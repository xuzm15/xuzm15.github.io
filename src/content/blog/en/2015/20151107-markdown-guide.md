I recently learned about Markdown, a clean format for writing text and code. Support for math formulas seems limited. Here is a short reference.

## Headings

In Markdown, add `#` and a space before text to make a heading.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

Up to six levels. To type a literal `#`, add a space before it.

## Lists

Use `*` for unordered lists and `1. 2. 3.` for ordered lists. Put a space between the marker and the text.

*   a
*   b
*   c

1.  a
2.  b
3.  c

Indent with spaces for nested lists.

## Blockquotes

Add `>` before the line:

> Example

## Links and images

`[name](url)` for links. For images, add `!` in front: `![alt](url)`.

## Bold and italic

One `*` pair for italic, two for bold, three for both.

## Code

Use backticks `` ` `` for inline code.

## Horizontal rule

Three asterisks `***` or dashes `---` make a horizontal line.

## Auto links

Angle brackets `<>` turn URLs and emails into links.

## Escape

Backslash `\` escapes special characters.

## Tools

Windows: MarkdownPad2  
Linux: Ubuntu
