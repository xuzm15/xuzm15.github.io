A short Vim reference for beginners, written while learning to keep up with the Emacs and Vim crowd.

OS: Ubuntu

Install: `sudo apt-get install vim-gtk`

Config: `sudo vim /etc/vim/vimrc`

Add at the end:

```
set nu        " line numbers on the left
set tabstop=4 " tab width 4
set nobackup  " no backup on overwrite
set cursorline " highlight current line
set ruler     " show cursor position in status line
set autoindent " auto indent
```

## Insert mode

Press `i` to enter Insert mode and edit text. Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.

## Normal mode

### Basic

*   `x` — delete character under cursor
*   `:wq` — save and quit (`:w` save, `:q` quit)
*   `dd` — delete current line (stored in clipboard)
*   `p` — paste below current line

### More

To be added as I learn more.
