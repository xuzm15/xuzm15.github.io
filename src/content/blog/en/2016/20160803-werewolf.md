I binged *Super Liar* and *Lying Man* at home and was impressed by JY’s werewolf play. Here are some thoughts from my own games.

I think the game is at heart about **mentality**. Logic, expression, and words all serve to read other players’ minds.

By mentality I mean: when you draw a role, you can’t help but adopt that role’s goals. Your job is to hide your real mentality and infer others’. For example, as a wolf you have a "kill" mentality. You want to eliminate gods and villagers but need excuses and need to sway votes. Unless you’re a deep wolf, not playing that way is basically throwing. The good side’s job is to find players with that mentality and vote them out.

You can hide a lot, but not your mentality or purpose—it’s what you need to win.

Brief role notes:

*   **Wolf**: Usually one deep wolf; their job is to hide (claim a strong role or play low-key villager).
*   **Seer**: Provide as much night info as possible, try to be sheriff, coordinate the good side, stay alive.
*   **Witch**: Save the seer for one night, poison a wolf, use night kills as half-seer info; reveal when it helps, after using potions.
*   **Hunter**: Identify players and hide; in "kill-all-sides" games try to get a shot off. Wolves often don’t kill hunter first when many gods are exposed. Unlike the seer, you contribute when you die.
*   **Idiot**: Similar to villager; in kill-all-sides, a well-hidden idiot is valuable.
*   **Villager**: Arguably hardest (least info). Priority: figure out who’s who, then consider claiming roles to take hits. Otherwise you might misclaim, play too hard, or vote out the seer.

In short, participate and talk—speaking more is step one to playing well (but don’t throw).
