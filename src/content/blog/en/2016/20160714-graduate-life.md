This post answers two things: what I think grad school should be, and how my first year actually went.

I didn’t have a strong reason to do a master’s at first—everyone was doing it. I wavered between going abroad and staying, then decided to try the entrance exam and go abroad a year later if it didn’t work out. I got in by a narrow margin and only then started looking for a reason to stay. The reason I found is still the same: after four years of EE, I’d feel bad not leaving something in academia.

After a year, besides courses, most of what I did in the lab was following others’ work, and not even that well. I did learn one thing: in our field, aside from materials, project work is mostly application; real innovation is rare. Doing application well is hard too, but it’s not quite what I had in mind.

Labs are usually project-driven—you work on what’s funded. That’s understandable, but it can feel like a cage. I imagined research as: get a broad view of the field, find what interests you, build on prior work, and look for something new, big or small, in unexplored corners.

My advisor said early on: unbounded exploration is research thinking; solving problems is engineering thinking. It took me a while to get it. (In practice "unbounded" still has to relate to projects, ha.)

So the compromise is: if you want to do grad school, try to find a group whose direction matches your interests.

Master’s and PhD are different. A master’s here is like a trial run for a PhD: you take courses and do research, but the bar is lower and you’re not expected to make a breakthrough.

What I actually did this year:

*   Finished the required courses and got my thesis topic approved.
*   Summarized my work so far and drafted a paper.
*   Took a JavaWeb micro-major on NetEase and got into the top three.
*   Started learning CNNs for image classification.
*   Settled on GitHub + Hexo + Next for the blog and added image hosting.

What I want to do next:

*   Publish, finish the project, graduate.
*   Keep up sports and music, and explore aesthetics (photo, PS, PPT, clothes, posters).
*   Figure out how to be a better programmer and how a slow-handed person can get better at games.

A small aside: I like fantasy novels and sometimes map things to "magic"—the staff (phone), sending messages (WeChat), wind-speed spell (bike, then cars), teleportation (planes, delivery), magic academy (university), adventurer’s guild (company). The only one without a match is the summoning stone with a warlock inside…

That’s it.
