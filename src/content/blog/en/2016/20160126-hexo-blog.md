I wanted to set up a blog on GitHub this semester. I tried Jekyll first but only got basic publishing working and the look wasn’t great. Near the new year I had more time and found Hexo easier to use, so I migrated the blog here.

This post only covers basic Hexo writing and deploy commands. For config and more, see the [Hexo docs](https://hexo.io/docs/).

# Prerequisites

Install Git and Node.js before Hexo. See their official sites.

OS: Windows 10

# Link GitHub account

(Optional: you can also log in when deploying.) To use GitHub with Hexo, add SSH: in Git Bash run `ssh-keygen`, add the public key to GitHub, then test:

```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Set user:

```
git config --global user.name "yourname"
git config --global user.email "youremail@email.com"
```

# Writing

New post:

```
hexo new [layout] <title>
```

Example: `hexo new "Hello World.md"`

# Deploy

One-command deploy: `hexo generate --deploy`

First install the deployer: `npm install hexo-deployer-git --save`

In `_config.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: <repository url>
  branch: [branch]
  message: [message]
```

# Common issues

If static generation fails after adding a new post, check for invalid characters in the Markdown (see e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/1228)).
