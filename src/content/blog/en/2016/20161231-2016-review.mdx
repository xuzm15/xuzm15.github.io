Another year at the turn of the calendar. Here’s the 2016 roundup.

I’ve written mid-year school summaries, year-end reviews, and birthday musings, and they overlap. From now on: mid-year = thoughts on the academic year; year-end = major events; birthday = personal growth. Of course I might mix when something needs saying.

Overall, the first half of the year was scattered—first-year courses and poor use of碎片 time left progress uneven. The second half was more stable with online courses and lab attendance (I’m not a fan of the latter, but it did help), so I did learn some things.

# Academics

*   Passed all required master’s courses and had my thesis topic approved.
*   Summarized my work so far and drafted a paper.
*   Took the NetEase JavaWeb micro-major and landed in the top three.
*   Started learning convolutional networks for image classification.
*   Settled on GitHub + Hexo + Next for the blog and added image hosting (Qiniu + MPic).

# Skills & life

*   Improved at singing—moved from "confident but off-key" to "listenable," found some mid-range, softer songs.
*   Kept up fitness for about half a year with some results; winter sent me backward.
*   Got more comfortable in the water; can stay afloat without looking too stressed.
*   Leveled up phone photo editing: Meitu → VSCO → Snapseed; obsessed with landscape edits.
*   Thought about how to actually play LOL, tried non-ADC roles and tried to be a more aggressive ADC—still losing, and it’s on me.

# 2017 goals

*   Publish, aim for an SCI paper, meet graduation requirements.
*   Brush up algorithms; take PAT and aim for full score.
*   Improve English; take the CET-6 seriously for once.
*   Decide direction and look for a job in Hangzhou.
*   Have a thesis draft outline by year-end.

Just passed midnight. No miracles, no superpowers, no aliens—2017 has started. I’ll do my best and try to have fewer regrets.
