with gender stereotypes and discrimination in the news industries than their male colleagues,which mirroring on their rank and file of positions in workplaces and gender bias in news coverage.It evident that journalism workplaces have overt discrimination and harassment of women workers,and Sieghart and Henry’s(1998) research revealed that a quarter of men and more than half the women who took part in their study had either experienced or witnessed stereotypes and discrimination of female journalists in newspaper environment.Therefore,considering the low status of women in journalism,it is worthwhile to establish a project to promotes gender equality and reduces gender stereotypes in newsroom.  

  

  
As journalism culture actually organised about a man-as-norm and women-as-interloper structure,even if it masquerades as a neutral news echos(Djerf-Pierre,2007).Women’ s capacities in journalism work are relatively concerned,while their domestic roles like mothers and wives are often take into primary consideration when they are working in the field.Under these circumstances,it suggested that women who desire to work in this kind of male-ordered fields need to establish strategies including incorporation with other professionals(Ross,2010),so a online website might an appropriate platform to gather journalists.
